# CO CONNECT

## Overview
Traditional platforms like NUWorks and Glassdoor fail to capture the complex aspects of co-op roles, such as workload variability, realistic responsibilities, and the work environment. Co-Connect provides a data-driven, intuitive solution designed to offer a deeper understanding of co-op experiences while streamlining the connection between students, employers, and advisors.

## Features
- **Post Feed**: Students can share co-op experiences and insights to better understand different industries. 
- **Job Listing Feed**: Employers can also share emerging job opportunities directly to their feed so students can stay updated about job trends. Students are able to apply directly from these posts for easy access.
- **Student Profiles**: Employers and Advisors are able to view and filter student profiles to better understand the range of applicants and their interests.
- **Employment Status**: Students are able to update their employment status directly from the platform, making it easier for employers to track availability.
- **Resumes**: Students can update and upload their resumes directly through the platform, providing easy access for employers and advisors to view and review students' qualifications.
