    We are *Co-Connect*, a Facebook like app for co-ops. <br>

    Our platform addresses the difficulties and frustrations felt by students 
    and employers in the co-op process. Co-ops offer students valuable 
    opportunities to jumpstart their careers in their chosen fields. However, 
    due to the limited information provided in job descriptions, students often
    find themselves realizing too late‚Äîonce they're already on the job‚Äîthat 
    the role doesn't meet their needs or expectations. <br>

    NUWorks, the current platform, lacks features such as workload variability, 
    work environment, realistic responsibilities, and much more. Northeastern 
    students need a platform that offers a realistic insight into the co-op world 
    and the industries they are preparing to enter. *Co-Connect* offers a more 
    intuitive, data-driven platform that is tailored to co-ops offered to Northeastern
    students. <br>

    Check out some of our features below!
